# A deque is a queue where you can add and remove from both ends.
# How Does a Deque Work?
A deque lets you:
  1. Add elements at the front
  2. Add elements at the back
  3. Remove elements from the front
  4. Remove elements from the back
It's like having a queue and a stack combined in one!
# Characteristics: of Deque:
Dynamic size: The size of a deque can change dynamically during the execution of a program.
Linear: Elements in a deque are stored linearly and can be accessed in a sequential manner.
Double Ended: Elements can be added and removed from both the front and the rear end
# Why Use a Deque?
A deque is useful when you need fast access to both ends of a list.
For example:
  Sliding Window Maximum Problem: We need to keep track of the largest number in a moving window.
  Undo/Redo Feature in text editors: You can go forward and backward in history.
  Web Browsers (Back & Forward Buttons): You can navigate pages in both directions.
